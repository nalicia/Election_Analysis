# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
This week we helped our friends Seth and Tom create a detailed analysis for the election commission. Through this analysis we seeked to find the answers to: 

* How many votes there were in total

* Who the candidates were

* How many of votes each candidate recieved

* What the percentage of votes that each candidate recieved was

* Who the winner is based on votes 

* What the voter turnout was for each county

* What the percentage of votes was from each county from the total count

* Which county had the largest turnout. 

## Election-Audit Results:
Using the great resource that python and a substantial amount of code we were able to deduce the following: There were a total of 369,711 votes total.

Arapahoe recieved 24,801 votes (6.7%) of the county votes.
Jefferson county recieved 38,855 votes (10.5%) of the county votes & 
finally, Denver had the greaest turnout with 306,055 votes. (82.8%) of the county votes.

After looping through I was able to pull how many votes each candidate recieved from the 3 counties.

The number of votes from each county are as followed:
Raymon Anthony Doane recieved 11,606 votes (3.1%) of the total votes. 
Charles Casper Stockham recieved 85,213 votes (23%) of the total votes.
Diana DeGette recieved 272,892 votes (73.8%) of the total votes. 
Its clear to see Diana Degette won the election with a staggering 73.1% of the votes. Talk about a landslide. 
## Audit Summary
Using this script to iterate through election data will be a cinche for those with the code. Its easy to change out variables (as long as you keep track) and easy to interpret. Even so, some modifications would need to be done to make this code better. I may write some code to determine what percentage of each county voted for what polictical candidate or party. To see if location has anything to do with political views. On a larger scale I would I would try to group the counties by size, to make things present evenly. Here i'd also look for the perecntages of the counties that voted for a particular person.
